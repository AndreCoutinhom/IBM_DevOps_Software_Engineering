# Welcome

Throughout this course, we will look at how businesses are being affected by disruption
and how a DevOps culture can help.
Weâ€™ll cover thinking differently through social coding and improving software reuse and sharing.
We will learn about ideas from Lean manufacturing such as working in small
batches to reduce waste and creating minimum viable products to gain valuable insight.
We will explore working differently by using test-driven and behavior-driven development
techniques to ensure repeatable behavior and high code quality.
You will see how adopting Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices ensure that
every change contributes to a potentially shippable feature.

The technology that was available to the disruptors is the same technology that is available to
the incumbents because most of it is open source.
The disruptors just had a different business model.

Some businesses survive and some businesses do not, but the message here is that technology
is the enabler of innovation.
It is not the driver of innovation.
You must have a great business model idea and a great model and then leverage that technology.
